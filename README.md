# Calculator DApp

## Overview

This is a decentralized application (DApp) called Calculator, built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using smart contracts.

## Features

- Perform arithmetic operations on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Connects to MetaMask for user authentication and transaction signing.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the smart contract.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React.js**: Utilized for building the user interface (UI) of the DApp.
- **Web3.js**: Interacts with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts from the frontend.
- **MetaMask**: Used for user authentication and signing transactions.

### Smart Contract

- **Solidity**: The programming language used for writing smart contracts.
- **Truffle Suite**: Used for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.

### Ethereum Blockchain

- **Ethereum**: The blockchain network used for deploying and executing smart contracts.
